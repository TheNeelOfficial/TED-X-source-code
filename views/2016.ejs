                                  <p>Antano Solar John is a tech evangelist who is passionate about revolutionizing the entire learning experience with the help of technology.You have a challenge? He has a solution.It all started with a passion for coding when he was as young as eight and within a few years he began helping engineering students with their projects by coding and debugging computer programs. While still in high school  he always wondered about why some of his friends could not learn and achieve like him. He set out to learn the tricks of the trade from  Dr.Richard Bandler and was thrilled to learn how elegantly and artfully one could overcome limiting factors in oneâ€™s life without wasting years carrying the heavy baggage of limiting beliefs, habits, behaviors and memories. He experimented how the patterns of Neuro Linguistic Programming worked in a variety of situations whenever he had time outside his busy career as the chief technology officer(CTO) of Nuveda.By then he had completed his Masters in Neuro Linguistic Programming under Dr.Richard Bandler. Having reached a new level of mastery and fully equipped to solve problems of a more complex nature, life soon presented him one serious challenge when a friend of his requested him to work with another friend who was paralyzed below the chest with a C5 condition. Now, it was no longer just fun but also a responsibility. A big responsibility.Today he Co-Owns School of Excellence with Harini Ramachandran with the vision of "Creating Generations and Generations of Excellence".</p>

                                  <p>Necessity is mother of invention. V. Srinivasa Chakravarthy, a professor at IIT Madras felt that  majority of Indian language scripts are organized in terms of vowels and consonants. If all those scripts represent nearly the same set of characters then why do we have so many scripts? A single script that represents all of them should suffice.  The thought of one language ignited seven years ago, to create a script with a simple goal of enabling communication in all language. a unified script that can convey information in all Indian languages, said the professor of biotechnology, whose work spans computational neuroscience and pattern recognition.</p>

                                  <p>Rasika was born in Dubai and later moved to the USA. Her mother comes from a musical background and encouraged her to take music lessons too. Rasika always wanted to learn the bansuri and later went on to play at ghazal concerts, which helped her immensely to understand music better. She is constantly working on innovating with the bansuri and also takes singing lessons in Mumbai. For her, CokeStudio@MTV has been an enriching experience both in terms of singing and playing the flute.</p>
